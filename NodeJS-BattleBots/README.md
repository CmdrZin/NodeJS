# NodeJS/NodeJS-BattleBots
  
This is a 'built from scratch' game that will use "NodeJS + socket.io" and "SocketIO for Unity from the Unity Asset Store" to 'network' the Roll-a-Ball tutorial game example. This plus the other four project should provide lots of examples for those who are builing their own multiplayer network game.   

The Client has built with Unity 2019.4.12f1(LTS).  

NOTE: Since the Library is not saved, Unity will import it the first time the Client 
project is loaded. Just close Unity after it builds the Library database and reopen it.  
Any random warnings should go away.   
   
Phase 1: The Client connects to the Server and console log messages are shown.   
Phase 2: Network players are spawned on local Client.
Phase 3: TODO: Pass motion information between Clients.

TODO: Complete the Roll-a-Ball game and make it multiplayer.
